<h1>Open-Faction-Tournaments</h1>

<p>There are 3 types of Open Faction Tournaments where we have Faction v's Faction Battles. These Battles include;
<ol>
  <li>The Faction v's Faction top 10 players in each Power League Tournament will determine who is the top 10 players in all the factions in each Power League. The tournament will run for 3 hours and each opponent is randomly chosen by the game with the winner proceeding and the looser is out. When the top 10 players are finally pitted against it each other, it will be a best of 3 series until we have a winner. Lots of rewards for all players who make the tournament and enter while we have very special rewards for the top 10 players of all factions especially the winner.</li>
  <p></p>
  <li>Faction v's Faction in the Super Hyperspace Arena Tournament are played once a week and your Faction faces of with another Faction for 6 hours. You can only loose 3 times other wise your out but if you keep winning you keep playing. The alliance with the most wins is named the victor. Lots of rewards for those participating and especially for the Victorious Faction.</li>
  <p></p>
  <li>All Factions 12 hour Battle Royal Super Hyperspace Arena Tournament in which all Factions are portalled to the Super Hyperspace Arena and battle random players from different factions. In this setting we are giving players the option to pick their battles so players can also attack Factions they think are easy targets so alot of research and profiling players are needed to gain the upper hand in this Tournament. Remembering also each faction has a bounty on their head and every time they win it goes up and every time they loose it goes down. The Faction with the most wins is the victor and wins their bounty and lots of other rewards too.</li>
  <p></p>
</ol>

These tournaments will be explained further as we get closer to the opening date of the game starting. There will be live in game chats to help factions co-ordinate game play, special missions for special nft's during play to complete and the most important is if your the Victorious Faction or Player your name is placed on the monoGames Trophy of the tournament.
